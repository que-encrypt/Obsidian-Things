Right as we approached 30k in profit, every major book limited our maximum wagers to pennies on the dollar, effectively making the system worthless.</p><p>So this product exists when the customer loses money, but ceases to exist when the customer makes money.

If you're a consistently winning bettor, you're going to get blocked pretty quickly when you're betting against the house. Why would a casino want to play a game where they don't have odds in their favor when they can just ban the sharps and feast on the casuals? With parimutuel wagering (horse racing, exchanges like BetFair-- there aren't major exchanges in the US, not enough margin for gambling lobby to go for yet) where you're wagering against other players, you won't get banned, since you're not consistently taking money from the house.</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

And the pit boss only asked if I'd like something nicer to drink than the well stuff and my host took very good care of me on the back end. Incidentally I didn't really win much, but that's not why I play. I like the dopamine hit from the risk, I like the sociality of table games, and I like having my host pay for the entire trip thanks to my play.

In a game with a 10% player edge, 28% of players managed to go bust[1]. Given the large number of rounds of betting for blackjack, without a good betting strategy, even players that count their way to a 2-3% edge are probably still going to make the casino money.</p><p>The downtown Casinos are much more uptight about advantage play, but I think that's because a lot of the pit bosses are old school and they just hate the idea of a player supposedly putting one over on them.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://neilhacker.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/kelly-criterion-biased-coin-copy.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://neilhacker.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/kelly-criteri...</a></p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The bookmaker is effectively the house. The bookmaker will set a market (make book) of prices on a certain event. You can choose to take the price offered and make a bet, or not. Essentially the bookmaker is pitting their skills and knowledge against yours.</span></p><p>The bookmaker will want all prices offered on the event to be in excess of 100%. The over round is where the bookmaker makes their profit. As an example, in a horse race, the percentage probabilities of all odds offered might add up to a total of 115%. That 15% is the bookmaker's margin.</p><p>Now, of course, the bookmaker doesn't necessarily profit in every race, but they should be trying to balance their book before the off, to insure that whatever the result they profit. They can do this by laying off liabilities with another bookmaker, shortening the odds on some runners, or just closing the book.</p><p>As a bettor, one should be trying to not just find the winner of races, but also prices which are wrong. If you assess the true odds of an event happening (let's say a horse winning) are better than the prices offered by the bookmaker, then it should be profitable to bet those prices in the long term. For example, if you think a horse has a 25% chance of winning the race, but the bookmaker is offering a price of 6/1 (7.0 or roughly 14%), then you have the odds in your favour and should make decent margin over time.</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
