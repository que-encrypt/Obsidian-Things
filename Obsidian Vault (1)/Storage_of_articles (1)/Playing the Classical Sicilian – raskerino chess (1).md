Not played much of recent, but have played the classical sicilian when I have played and it’s led to some interesting games!

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 the move that defines the classical sicilian 6.Bg5 usually thought to be the only critical line 6…Bd7 more common is …e6, the idea of this is very quick queenside development and pressure on the c file, 7.Qd2 Rc8 8.0-0-0 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 Qa5

The Main Tabiya of the Opening

Black has developed their queenside essentially without touching the kingside. …Nxd4! means …Qa5 is now hitting the unprotected bishop on g5. White chooses between three moves here. At lower levels the most popular is Bxf6, closely followed by f4 and then Bd2 some way behind. At master level we have Bd2, followed by f4 and then Bxf6 well behind. The opposite ordering!

Each works a bit differently. Against 10.f4 black goes for an exchange sac …Rxc3! and complex play ensues. White’s better if they know what they’re doing but I think the positions are interesting and hope to get some games in it. Against 10.Bd2 I go 10…a6 and work from there. 10.Bxf6 was played in the game:

10.Bxf6 gxf6

Like in so many sicilians, white should play Kb1

When black can choose between the neutralizing …Qc5 and the more ambitious …Rg8 with an idea we may see shortly. My opponent went 11.Bc4?! when I was pretty sure I must have a good position, but wasn’t sure which plan to take. 11…Qc5 certainly looks pleasant, white’s bishop will lose time and it’s not obvious it’s happy to have gone to the a2-g8 diagonal with queen’s off. 11…Rg8 on the other hand is actually a queenside oriented move, I thought their c4 bishop might prove a target (their queen is temporarily tied to defending it) and thus went for the more ambitious path:

11…Rg8 12.Rhg1?! (just go 12.g3) 12…f5! a typical break 13.exf5 Bg7

![Screenshot 2020-02-12 at 11.20.08 PM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-12-at-11.20.08-pm.png?w=660)

The opening has gone well and black is clearly better, how will I blow it? Comp gives -1 already!

I missed 14.Qd5, but this is fine, 14…Qxd5 15.Bxd5 Bxc3 16.bxc3

![Screenshot 2020-02-12 at 11.21.00 PM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-12-at-11.21.00-pm.png?w=660)

What to do?

I wasn’t sure if I want f5 or c3 in exchange for b7. Then I thought, why give up b7 at all? And thus played 16…b5? missing my opponent’s very nice shot 17.f6! e6 18.Be4 d5 19.Bxh7 Rh8 20.Bd3 and I went 20…Rxh2?? allowing 21.Rh1! which I saw but for some reason thought I had to allow. I definitely don’t! Instead 20…Rh6 going for f6 or 20…Rxc3 keeps the game alive. My opponent missed 21.Rh1! and we went on to draw, though, and this is somewhat relevant to the opening, I was up enough time out of the opening I could’ve easily clocked them when the draw was offered, but I figured it’d be rude.

But what should I have done? 16…Rxc3 17.Bxb7? Bxf5 is nice for black, but there’s still 17.f6! and it’s about equal. Best is 16…Bxf5! avoiding all this f6 nonsense when 17.Bxb7 Rxc3 transposes to the above but cutting out the f6 option, white 17.Kb2 Rc5! is cute as white can’t take b7 due to …Rb5+. Anyway it’s obvious black is better in these lines, white’s structure is a wreckage.

So nice find of f6 by my opponent, shame I missed it, and very nice result of the opening. 11.Bc4?! already gave me at least equality, I went the ambitious route and got very favorable imbalances out of it.

Then I played a couple games where 8.f4 was played, I didn’t know the theory and I busted myself. Let’s ignore those (I did check theory, I strayed so early there’s not much point looking at the games theoretically – and lines are so long they’d be a pain to give, maybe I’ll see it again and we’ll have a proper game to explore?).

Then I got this weirdness of a game against an IM:

1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 d6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nc6 6.Be3 I’m not particularly prepped against anything other than 6.Bg5 but I have decided to go for a boleslavsky here with 6…e5 rather than 6…Ng4. So 6…e5 7.Ndb5!?

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.28.13 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.28.13-am.png?w=660)

Huh, that’s weird. 6.Nf3 and 6.Nb3 are the main moves. I think 6.Nf3 is generally preferable against the Classical and 6.Nb3 against the Najdorf – the key difference is the a pawn. After 6.Nb3 here I can quickly play …a5-a4 while in the Najdorf black has already spent a tempo on a6, so …a6-a5-a4 is not near as efficient. Hence Nf3 is standard.

6.Ndb5 a6 7.Na3 b5 8.Nd5

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.30.03 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.30.03-am.png?w=660)

And here I made the first of many moves where I instantly hit myself in the face after in disgust, luckily, the blunder was missed (9…Rb8 is best):

9…Be7?? 10.Nxe7?? (10.Bb6 followed by Nc7+ 1-0) now here it’d be reasonable to stop looking at this game, but, well, it got fun. 10…Qxe7 11.c4 b4 12.Nc2 and for some reason after knowing I couldn’t play it before, I thought the insertion of the last move made 12…Nxe4?? playable, 13.Qd5

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.32.24 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.32.24-am.png?w=660)

Ugh, I’ve played this game so badly

13…Bb7 14.Qxe4 b3!

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.33.25 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.33.25-am.png?w=660)

Hey hey I did a clever

I saw 14…Nd4 15.Qd3 was nothing, but …Nb4 would stop Qd3 and the queen can’t stay connected to the c2 knight! Qf5 can be met by …g6. So I played 14…b3! to open up b4 with tempo. However, my opponent calmly played 15.Na3! 0-0?! (apparently 15…bxa2 is better) 16.Qb1? f5 and I’m actually not horribly lost!

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.35.28 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.35.28-am.png?w=660)

Sure black is lost but I have some play now and it’s only baaaaarely lost

17.axb3 f4 18.Bd2 e4 19.Bc3 f3?

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.36.37 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.36.37-am.png?w=660)

I thought this was clever, fix the f pawn before pushing …e3

But it allows Nc2 and white defends. Should’ve gone 19…Ne5! threatening …f3 when Nc2 could be met by …fxg2 and …Nd3+. Oops. Luckily my opponent played 20.g3 e3 21.Bd3

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.39.19 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.39.19-am.png?w=660)

I’m actually equal now!

And even played a good move in 21…Ne5 (21…exf2+ can be inserted first, and is probably a tad better, I was worried that’d give them time for Kxf2 and at some point Re1 with tempo), 22.Bxh7+ I thought this was a mistake I figure white’ll lose tempo getting the bishop out but the computer is fine with it 22…Kh8 23.Bxe5?? Qxe5? and I hit myself in the head for the final time this game here, having realized I’d just missed a useful moment to insert 23…exf2+! now they might have time to escape, though castling isn’t all that scary my queen may be able to get to g2. The position is very good.

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.42.08 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.42.08-am.png?w=660)

24.Bd3? exf2+?? weirdly the win was 24…Qa5+! coming to d2. Not a move I was considering at all but it’s a very clean win. 25.Kxf2?? the king needed to run the other way 25…Qd4+ 26.Kf1 f2? (26…Rae8! threatens the surprising and devastating …Re2! but this works)

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 2.44.28 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-2.44.28-am.png?w=660)

Black’s still winning

27.Qd1! is the only move that keeps the game alive, 27…Bf3 (27…Rf6 apparently wins the most, why? Not a clue) 28.Nc2? Qg4! 29.h3 Qxg3 30.Qxf3 Qxf3 0-1

Fun silly game where I hung an exchange, it was missed, hung a piece, it was taken, but then I think found some exciting compensation. 14…b3! was certainly my best move of the game, but I’m pleased with 19…f3? too even though it was wrong. Anyway, not important theoretically, black was just better out of the opening (or, as played by me, quickly down a piece), but it was fun. And somehow beat an IM out of it too. Wack.

Game 3 I won on the clock but handled very badly:

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 12.44.15 PM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-12.44.15-pm.png?w=660)

Why oh why did I automatically go 7…Nxd4? The whole point is that the white queen has to move twice (d2 and d4) and is distracted from defending g5. Here g5 is already undefended, ergo 7…Qa5 first makes loads of sense. 7…e6 is also good. Instead by playing 7…Nxd4? I just give white free tempo.

Errors like this betray complete lack of understanding of the moves, but, I hope, are good to make once? Lets me be reminded, and causes me to re-verbalize why and when black takes on d4. Embarrassing, but not harmful.

Game 4 I should’ve lost after handling the middlegame badly but clocked them:

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 Bd7 7.Qd2 Rc8 8.Nxc6!?

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 1.08.53 PM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-1.08.53-pm.png?w=660)

You know, Grischuk is right. Explore broadly (first at least) not deeply. That main tabiya on move 9? Just because every move on the way is very likely (at the master level at least), 7.Qd2 is played about 2/3rds of the time, and 8.0-0-0 about half, means that combined you only get there 1/3rd of 6.Bg5 classical sicilian games. It’s the key starting position, and yet…

Aside: Studying openings are weird aren’t they? Say you’re 1500 and as white you perform like a 1550 and black 1450 (this is basically average). You study some line quite a lot, and it even starts fairly early. Let’s say you suddenly become really, extraordinarily good at the sicilian dragon. You’re suddenly 1700 strength (as black!) in the sicilian dragon. Let’s use slightly higher lichess ratings than that (as lichess is a bit inflated and also because how the database works it’s a better search (the only section below this one includes all games down to 100 rated and thus I suspect is less representative). There are maybe 43 million games in the database at this level and 1.e4 is in almost 23 million, for simple math we’ll call that half. 1…c5 is met by 2.Nf3 about 7/12ths of the time, and 2…d6 is met by 3.d4 about 2/3rds. So if we multiply out those probabilities you’re getting the dragon 7/36ths of the time or just under 20%. We’ll call it 20%. Oh, and you’re only black half the time, so it occurs in 10% of your games. Now your black performance is 1450\*0.8+1700\*0.2 = 1500. Huh, I wonder if I cheated to make the math work out cleanly. Your overall ratings goes from 1500 (1550 white, 1450 black) to 1525 (1550 white, 1500 black). That is… a 25 point jump for becoming 250 points stronger in your main defense against the most popular white first move! Doesn’t that seem like a very, very small jump?

Continued aside: Plugging in other numbers, if you were suddenly 2000 at the dragon, over 500 higher, you’d go up to 1555 overall. That truly does seem tiny. If the dragon suddenly became a horrible weakness of yours and you collapsed to 1000 strength in it, your rating would only drop to 1455. So do openings not matter so much? That you could be horribly bad at your main opening only concedes 45 points, and being phenomenal at it only gains 55? Well, I think people tend not to have one opening weakness. Having one tends to coincide with having others. Further, if you were 2000 (or 1700) at the specific opening I suspect it can’t just be that you memorized a lot that doesn’t apply to any other chess positions you ever reach, working on the opening often is surprisingly good for the rest of your game too. So I don’t think this means opening improvement is a lot of work for relatively little reward, but I do think people overstate having problems in a specific line as a problem to their overall play. Sure, work on it, but it’s not going to be that impactful overall, and if it’s a specific sub-variation of the dragon, well, the dragon overall is only happening 10% of the time! How often can that sub-variation occur? Still, if you regularly play someone who does a specific thing, definitely get prepped on that thing.

Okay back to our regularly scheduled programming. They took my knight on c6. I did not prepare for this at all.

8…Bxc6 9.f3

![Screenshot 2020-02-13 at 1.32.30 PM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/screenshot-2020-02-13-at-1.32.30-pm.png?w=660)

9…Qa5?! low experience in an opening means making the moves you’re familiar with regardless of the situation. Here …e6, …a6 and …h6 are more useful moves than …Qa5 which doesn’t attack g5 and can be vulnerable to Nd5 tricks.

10.0-0-0 h6 11.Be3 e6 12.Kb1 a6 all normal, fine moves, 13.Bd3 maybe a little slow 13…Be7 the computer slightly prefers …Qc7 suggesting my queen placement really is just silly here, not by any substantial gap, I just think it’s telling that it already wants to re-position my queen, 14.g4 Nd7 15.Qf2?= the queen is actually really well aligned against my a5 on d2, 15…b5 16.Ne2 b4 17.h4 Bb5 18.Nd4 Ne5 19.b3?! and here I took on d3 with the bishop when I should’ve taken knight, castled and stuck a rook on c3. All in all, I made normal moves that were mostly fine and got a nice position, though white had a solid +1 advantage much of the time, due to the misplacement of …Qa5.

Again, not too concerned about this one, I’m gaining familiarity and when doing so you make the moves you’ve seen. As you play a line more you see more moves and ideas and get a better sense of when they happen. In the last game I played …Nxd4 when there was no need to prepare …Qa5. Here …Qa5 did little and I should’ve made a normal move. Tricky.

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Be3 e5

![Screenshot 2020-02-23 at 2.09.25 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/screenshot-2020-02-23-at-2.09.25-am.png?w=660)

Boleslavsky Structure

6…Ng4 is also possible, harassing the e3 bishop but I think white has some annoying options there as said previously. Plus, by playing …e5 I can handle Be2 and Be3 similarly and get practice in the structure.

7.Nf3 h6!?

Against the Najdorf’s …e5 black usually goes Nb3, here Nf3 is preferred, black hasn’t spent a move on …a6 and thus can play …a5-a4 faster, discouraging Nb3. 7…Be7 is usually preferred to 7…h6!? and yeah, it may get played anyway but it’s not necessary yet. Not my finest move, and a sign of not knowing the opening. I was vaguely scared of Bc4 and either Ng5 or the subtler Bg5 intending to trade on f6 and dominate d5.

8.Bc4 Be6!?

In general I’d be happy to see white exchange on e6, giving me an extra central pawn, but 8…Be7 is normal and more popular, preparing to castle.

9.Bb3 Be7 10.0-0 0-0 11.Qe2 a6 12.Rfd1 Qc7

![Screenshot 2020-02-23 at 2.14.38 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/screenshot-2020-02-23-at-2.14.38-am.png?w=660)

Nh4-f5 is an interesting idea that wasn’t played

In the Boleslavsky structure white should always look to exploit the weakened light squares. Hence how happy black is to see Bxe6 …fxe6 gaining great control over d5 and f5.

13.Rd2?! Rac8 14.Rad1 Rdf8?! (14…Na5!) 15.h3 Na5 16.Nd5?! Nxd5 17.exd5?! Bf5 18.c3

![Screenshot 2020-02-23 at 2.16.56 AM.png](https://raskerino.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/screenshot-2020-02-23-at-2.16.56-am.png?w=660)

Black has a fine position, white has no targets, a crummy bishop on b3 and black has straightforward plans on either side of the board, moving the bishop and playing …f5 or going for …b5, still I’m surprised the computer gives black over a pawn advantage here

Fantastic position out of the opening. Let’s mess it up. I chose a little poorly here, retreating the f5 bishop first is better:

18… Nc4?! 19.Bc2? Nxe3?

19…Bd7! keeps a threat of …Nxb2, avoids trade of bishops and prepares …f5. Tough move to find though. The rest of the game went suspiciously, so let’s skip a bit:

20.Qxe3 Bxc2 21.Rxc2 b5 22.b3 f5 23.Qd2 Qc5 24.c4 b4 25.Ne1 Bg5 26.Qe2 a5 27.Qh5 Kh7 28.Nf3

Oops

28…Bf6? (29…Kg8 is the best way to lose the pawn) 29.Qxf5+ Kh8 30.Nh2 Rf8 31.Ng4 Be7 32.Qg6 Bg5 33.g3? Rf3? 34.Kg2? Rcf8 35.h4 Be7?! 36.Rd3 R3f5 37.Nxh6

I felt clever finding a win here

37…R5f6 0-1

But totally missed I have the simple 37…Rxf2+ duh. Still, great position out of the opening, made some mistakes focusing so much on the queenside and lost my f pawn, then confused the game enough to win.

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 Bd7 7.Qd2 Rc8 8.0-0-0 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 Qa5

Black has fun in this line

10…Rxc3!

The classic sicilian sacrifice! White should take back b pawn but it looks scary allowing …Qxa2 – in fact white wins after that error, but if white doesn’t know the theory they’ll try and keep their pawns together and allow black pleasant play.

11.Qxc3?! Qxc3 12.bxc3 Nxe4

Black will get a second pawn for the exchange

Fun position to play, black has a _lot_ of pawns to push.

13.Bh4 Nxc3 14.Rd4!?

Clever move, the knight gets trapped on a2, but Rd3 is better

Bunch of options

…Ne4 and …Nd4 were what I chose between, but interesting is 15…g5!? and best is 15…Na4+! 16.Kc1 (going forward just gives black useful checks) 16…g6

15…Ne4?! 16.Bd3 f5 17.a4 g6 (17…g5! is also possible but this is strong, black’s close to winning) 18.Bxe4 Bxe4?! (18…fxe4! get that central pawn mass rolling! 19.c3 Bg7?! (dumb, just take the pawn) 20.Rd2 Kd7?! (20…Bh6!) 21.Bf2 a6? (no! take the pawn on g2!) 22.Bd4 Bxd4 23.cxd4 Rc8 24.Rc1 Rxc1 25.Kxc1 Kc6 26.Kb2 Kd5?!

After a flurry of bad moves from me we go from probably winning to slightly worse

And eventually we drew.

All in all, pleased with the positions I got in the classical sicilian here, my play was OK I think, but no better, and most importantly I really enjoyed the games, playing complex sicilian structures I have minimal familiarity with. I sometimes get into phases where all my moves are rote and mindless and automatic? And it can be delightful to play some new structures and be forced to think in each.
